CVS
~~~
The Glade-3 repository is hosted at cvs.gnome.org
To check out a copy of Glade-3 you can use the following commands:

Patches
~~~~~~~
Patches must be in the unified format (diff -u) and must include a
ChangeLog entry. Send your patches to the mailing list and/or file
them in bugzilla (see above)


Coding Style
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Code in Glade-3 should follow the GNOME Programming Guidelines
(http://developer.gnome.org/doc/guides/programming-guidelines/),
basically this means being consistent with the sorrounding code.
The only exception is that we prefer having braces always on a new line
e.g.:

if (...)
{
	...
}

Note however that a lot of the current codebase still uses the following
style:

if (...) {
	...
}

Over time we'll migrate to the preferred form.

Naming conventions:
- function names should be lowercase and prefixed with the
  file name (or, if the function is static and the name too long,
  with an abbreviation), e.g:
  glade_project_window_my_function () 
  gpw_my_loooooooooong_named_fuction ()
- variable names should be lowercase and be short but self explanatory;
  if you need more than one word use an underscore, e.g:
  my_variable

Also try to order your functions so that prototypes are not needed.
