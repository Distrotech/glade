New features and fixes
======================
   - The amazing new menu editor is here ! (Juan Pablo Ugarte)
   - Added GladeEditorProperty objects, a GtkWidget descendant
     capable of editing properties (one subclass available for
     every method of editing properties).
   - GladeProjectView displays internal widget descriptors and
     special-child-type descriptors
   - Project menu item glitch fixed.
   - Fixed "paste" using keyboard shortcuts
   - Show "save as" dialog on save when previous save failed
   - Added widgets GtkCombo, GtkList, GtkCList, ComboBox & ComboBoxEntry
   - Delete in property editor not to delete project widgets (only text
     in entries).
   - Text properties now scroll (bugzilla 316232)
   - Translate strings from catalog files (this includes translating
     the gtk+.xml.in using intltool & using dgettext on strings parsed
     from the catalog).
   - Implemented command groups (for undo/redo actions on a complex
     series of glade commands), used by the new editor.
   - Undo/Redo buttons now display action content in tooltips.
   - Added GladeEPropObject, generic support for object type properties.
   - Updated plugin writer documentation (widgets/adding-widgets.txt)
   - All project paths are now absolute canonical paths
   - Added GladeEPropResource for resource file type properties,
     glade will try to always keep a copy of all project resources
     in the same directory as the glade file.
   - Fixed signal loading (bug 326715)
   - Fixed persisting i18n metadata (bug 325628)
   - Implemented <requires> functionality in glade files
     (save required plugins and gracefully display errors if
     the requested catalog isnt available).
   - Multiple projects with the same name now supported.
   - Misc bugfixes and code improvements from myself Juan Pablo Ugarte and
     Lluis Sanchez Gual
