TODO (Last update: November 14, 2003)
===================================

This file may be out of date: to avoid duplicated efforts ask on 
glade-devel@ximian.com before starting any work.

Here you can find a list of TODOs for glade3; items marked with [X] are
completed, items marked with [W] are work in progress.
You may also want to check the glade3 module in bugzilla.gnome.org.

Please keep in mind that for the first milestone we just want to clone the
orignal glade, except the following:

minus :
- gtk advanced widgets
- gnome/gnome-db widets
- bonobo controls
(these will become additional catalogs which can be added at runtime)

plus :
- Undo/redo
- Multiple project support



Difficult or Big tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[W] Implement the menu editor.
[ ] Finish support for all the Gtk widgets. In particular the following widget
    are known to be currently broken:
    * menu/menubar (see menu editor)
    * toolbar (probably should only need some custom methods in glade-gtk)
    * entry (works fine, but the selection drawing is wrong)
[ ] Implement the glade-property type "File". For example to be used with a 
    pixmap that specifies a file.
[X] Undo/Redo infrastructure.
[X] Undo/Redo for add/delete, cut/paste, set name, set property.
[X] Undo/Redo for add/remove signal.
[X] Cut/Copy/Paste.
[X] The packing tab of the editor. This is done, but it may turn out that we
    want to override some of the packing properties from the xml file.
[X] Make new catalogs actually "pluggable" (e.g. having glade-gtk.so instead
    of the temporary hack in glade-gtk.[ch] )
[X] Win32 port
[ ] Update the build system (this actually isn't difficult or big, but some
    autotools knowledge is required; pay attention to not break Windows port)


Normal tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[X] Implement the about box. We were lazily waiting for GtkAbout (see bugzilla
    #109435) but it seems it will be delayed to Gtk+-2.6.
[ ] Implement file opened history feature (without EggRecent stuff since we don't
    want to have additional deps)
[ ] The tree view does not remember if the "leafs" are opened or closed
    when switching between projects, or when reconstructing it. The tree view
    should remember the states of the leafs. Some of this functionality might
    have to go into gtk. Also if we have something like :
    A
     \
      B__ C
      | 
      \__ D
    When hiding the childs of "A" and showing them again, the state of B and its
    childs is lost, this should go into gtk+.


Non Developer tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[ ] Design missing icons for some of the widgets (e.g. GtkProgressBar)
[ ] Review the translation stuff since it may be way out of date (translation
    themself may wait when strings are less likely to change)
[ ] Move the documentation which is in glade-2 (Maybe it's better wait also
    with this one)


Not Yet (Items that we need to do, but are not a priority right now)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problems found with the gtk-spin button
- Does not emit a click up, click down signal
- If you change the max or min of the adjustment and emit an adjustment
  changed signal it does not evaluates if the current value is inside the range
- The inability to be used without an adjustment (clock)

discuss with jamesh
- How are we going to save pixmaps
- How are we going to save custom widgets
- How are we going to save gtkadjusments of gtkspinbuttons
- How are we going to save entry properties for a gtk_combo
