This is the current state of the TODO items for glade2. Please keep
in mind that for the first milestone we just want to clone the orignal
glade minus :
- gtk advanced widgets
- gnome/gnome-db widets
- bonobo controls
plus :
- Undo/redo
- Multiple project support

TODO
====

TAKEN ITEMS (someone is already working on)
-----------
- File loading and saving
- Cleaning and adding new .xml descriptions for widgets
- Signal editor
- Common part of the editor

OPEN ITEMS [PLease let me know before starting working on any of this]
----------
- Implement glade_widget_delete inside glade-widget.c, delete can already
be called from the popup menu.
- Implement the popup menu option "Select", it needs to create submenus for
every parent widget and a "Select" option inside it. Inside glade-popup.c
- Implement file opened history feature.
- Implement gtk stock buttons.
- gtklabels can't be selected. This looks like a fun thing and maybe tricky
to fix. I am guessing that gtklabeles don't like the idea of disabling
double buffering because of pango, but this is just a guess.
- Implement show clipboard (blocks on copy/cut)
- Fix "click thru". When we click on a widget we grab the mouse clicked event.
This does not allow checkbuttons to be set/unset or buttons to be pressed.
- Implement the menu bar widget and the menu editor. 
- Implement the glade-property type "File". For example to be used with a pixmap
that specifies a file.
- Fix multiple lines GladeEditor text entries. See glade-editor.c,
function : glade_editor_create_input_text.
- Implement tooltips for the "Widget" page of the widget editor.

NOT-SO-EASY TO IMPLEMENT ITEMS
------------------------------
This items may prove tricky to implement if they are "done right"
- The packing tab of the editor
- Undo/Redo
- Copy/Cut/Paste

NOT YET (Items that we need to do, but are not a priority right now)
------- 
- Implement the custom widget
