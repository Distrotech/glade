Need proper conversion routine:
   currently adjustments are saved as data in libglade and as objects in builder,
we need a conversion "routine" to be run, to create/remove the nescisary objects
and modify the project as needed when converts take place - this should also help
clean things up wrt the internal icon factory cache for pixbufs. 

Its possible that as a result of project conversions, we will dump/lose our
command history.
