This is the current state of the TODO items for glade2. Please keep
in mind that for the first milestone we just want to clone the orignal
glade minus :
- gtk advanced widgets
- gnome/gnome-db widets
- bonobo controls
plus :
- Undo/redo
- Multiple project support

TODO
====

OPEN ITEMS [PLease let me know before starting working on any of this]
----------
- Implement glade_widget_delete inside glade-widget.c, delete can already
be called from the popup menu.
- Implement the popup menu option "Select", it needs to create submenus for
  every parent widget and a "Select" option inside it. Inside glade-popup.c
- Implement file opened history feature.
- Implement gtk stock buttons.
- gtklabels can't be selected. This looks like a fun thing and maybe tricky
  to fix. I am guessing that gtklabeles don't like the idea of disabling
  double buffering because of pango, but this is just a guess.
- Implement show clipboard (blocks on copy/cut)
- Implement the menu bar widget and the menu editor. 
- Implement the glade-property type "File". For example to be used with a pixmap
that specifies a file.
- Implement tooltips for the "Widget" page of the widget editor.
- The tree view does not remember if the "leafs" are opened or closed
  when switching between projects, or when reconstructing it. The tree view
  should remember the states of the leafs. Some of this functionality might
  have to go into gtk. Also if we have something like :
  A
   \
    B__ C
    | 
    \__ D
  When hiding the childs of "A" and showingt htem again, the state of B and its
  childs is lost, this should go into gtk+.
- Implement the about box.
- Adding new widgets 

NOT-SO-EASY TO IMPLEMENT ITEMS
------------------------------
This items may prove tricky to implement if they are "done right"
- The packing tab of the editor
- Undo/Redo
- Copy/Cut/Paste
    
DONE [just as a reference]
--------------------------
(Chema)
- Fix user query for properties that are loaded with paramspec. Take a look
  at why gtktable query (non-ParamSpec) works and not vbox (Loading with
  ParamSpec)
- Fix "click thru". When we click on a widget we grab the mouse clicked event.
  This does not allow checkbuttons to be set/unset or buttons to be pressed.
- Fix multiple lines GladeEditor text entries. See glade-editor.c,
function : glade_editor_create_input_text.
(Shane)
- Signal editor
    	
NOT YET (Items that we need to do, but are not a priority right now)
------- 
- Implement the custom widget
