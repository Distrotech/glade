What is this?
=============

build_glade.sh is a script that builds glade mswindows binaries. It
is only expected to function when run from a released source tarball.

A binary zip archive is generated:
    - without Python support
    - for each Python version listed in the INTERPRETERS variable


How does it work?
=================

Install the deps (gtk+-bundle, ...) and MinGW/MSYS with GCC 4.5.0
  $ mingw-get.exe install gcc
  $ mingw-get.exe install msys-base

Configure the REV, GTKBUNDLE and INTERPRETERS variables in the
build_glade.sh script and run the following from MSYS bash:

  $ cd path/to/glade3/sources/
  $ build/mswindows/build_glade.sh

Built binaries are intalled into:

  $ ls build/mswindows/tmp/

and redistributable archives are installed into:

  $ ls build/mswindows/dist

build_glade.sh has been heavily inspired by Tor Lillqvist's <tml@iki.fi>
windows build scripts (http://www.gtk.org/download-windows.html). Many
thanks for his years of windows related GTK+ work!
