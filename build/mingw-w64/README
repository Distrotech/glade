This script files is intended to cross compile glade for windows under linux
using the mingw-w64 toolchain download-mingw-rpm [1] script to get precompiled depencies

I develop it under Debian sid so it should also work on Ubuntu and others Debian
based distributions.

It does not really has any dependency on Debian other than it uses apt-get to
install mingw-w64, nsis and p7zip-full packages. So if you have those packages
installed on your system it should work out of the box on others linuxs and perhaps unices?
BTW it needs python3 and wget, but those are probably already installed in your
system.

If you really want to compile on windows I guess a good aproach would be
to install cygwin [2] to get a unix like env to run configure and shell scripts,
install mingw gcc package using download-mingw-rpm [1] and update the script
system env variables accordingly.
