The DTD for the XML files is included with libglade, and is\r\nalso at http://glade.gnome.org/glade-2.0.dtd.\r\nOther tools are available which can turn the XML files into source code\r\nin languages such as C++, Perl and Python.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout Glade-3\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nThis version of Glade (Glade-3) is a complete rewrite of the original Glade codebase.\r\n\r\nOne of the main differences from glade-2 is that C code generation has been removed from \r\nglade-3: this has been done on purpose, since using generated code is deprecated; the preferred \r\nway to use glade files is with libglade (if code generation is needed, this can be provided \r\nas another tool or plugin, code generation is simply not a part of the glade-3 project).\r\nAnother main difference is that glade-3 was designed to make maximal use of GObject\r\nintrospection, thus easing the integration of external toolkits and handling widgets,\r\nsignals and properties genericly; thus making it easier to write fancy features in the \r\nfuture (toolkits such as gtk+ itself, gnome, gnome-db and any others are implemented \r\nexternaly as widget catalogs with optional support libraries, thus catalogs may be \r\ndistributed seperatly; possibly along with their libglade support modules).\r\n\r\nIt has a few useful new features such as stacked Undo/Redo and Multiple Project support\r\nand respects the same XML format as glade-2.\r\n\r\nFor a more details on what has changed, what still needs work, etc. see\r\nthe NEWS file & the glade3 product at bugzilla.gnome.org.\r\nComments, bug reports and patches are more than welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nGlade is distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), as described\r\nin the COPYING file.\r\nNote that you are free to use whatever license you like for the source code\r\ngenerated by Glade.

If you have GNOME 2 you\r\n   should already have this.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nSee the file 'INSTALL'\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
