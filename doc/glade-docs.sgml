Glade is a RAD tool to enable quick and easy development of user interfaces
for the Gtk+ toolkit and the GNOME desktop environment.
The user interfaces designed in Glade are stored in XML format,
enabling easy integration with external tools.
In particular libglade can load the XML files and create the interfaces
at runtime. The DTD for the XML files is included with libglade, and is
also at http://glade.gnome.org/glade-2.0.dtd.
Other tools are available which can turn the XML files into source code
in languages such as C++, Perl and Python.

This version of Glade (Glade-3) is a complete rewrite of the original Glade codebase.
    </para>

    <para>
    One of the main differnces from glade-2 is that C code generation has been removed from 
glade-3: this has been done on purpose, since using generated code is deprecated; the preferred 
way to use glade files is with libglade (if code generation is needed, this can be provided 
as another tool or plugin, code generation is simply not a part of the glade-3 project).
Another main difference is that glade-3 was designed to make maximal use of GObject
introspection, thus easing the integration of external toolkits and handling widgets,
signals and properties genericly; thus making it easier to write fancy features in the 
future (toolkits such as gtk+ itself, gnome, gnome-db and any others are implemented 
externaly as widget catalogs with optional support libraries, thus catalogs may be 
distributed seperatly; possibly along with their libglade support modules).

It has a few useful new features such as stacked Undo/Redo and Multiple Project support
and respects the same XML format as glade-2.
