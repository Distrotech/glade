General Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Glade is a RAD tool to enable quick & easy development of user interfaces
for the Gtk+ toolkit and the GNOME desktop environment.
The user interfaces designed in Glade are stored in XML format,
enabling easy integration with external tools.
In particular libglade can load the XML files and create the interfaces
at runtime. The DTD for the XML files is included with libglade, and is
also at http://glade.gnome.org/glade-2.0.dtd.
Other tools are available which can turn the XML files into source code
in languages such as C++, Perl and Python.


About Glade-3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This version of Glade (Glade-3) is a complete rewrite of the original
Glade codebase.
It has useful new features (Undo/Redo, MultiProject support) and has a
cleaner architecture, note however that it is not ready yet for everyday
use and lacks support for additional widgets, as Gnome and Gnome-db widgets.
One of the main differnces from glade-2 is that C code generation has been
removed from glade-3: this has been done on purpose, since using generated
code is deprecated; the preferred way to use glade files is with libglade.
Another important thing to note is that the XML format has _not_ changed, 
so you can work on the same project both with glade-3 and with glade-2.
For a more details on what has changed, what still needs work, etc. see
the NEWS, BUGS and TODO files.
Comments, bug reports and patches are more than welcome.


License
~~~~~~~

Glade is distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), as described
in the COPYING file.
Note that you are free to use whatever license you like for the source code
generated by Glade. (We do not consider the code generated by Glade to be
'a work based on the Program' as described at the start of the GPL.)


Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

 o GTK+ 2.0.0 or above - http://www.gtk.org
   You also need the glib, pango and atk libraries.
   Make sure you have the devel packages as well, as these will contain the
   header files which you will need to compile C applications.

 o libxml 2.4.1 - used to parse the XML files. If you have GNOME 2 you
   should already have this.


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

See the file 'INSTALL'
